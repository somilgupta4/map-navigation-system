# Map-navigation-system
Map navigation system using C++ and C graphics 

This project has a predefined-map in which user inputs its source and destination and the code generates the shortest path between source and destination.
The path is highlighted on the map too with different colour.

The program is based on dijikshtra's algorithm.

The project was ran in "CODEBLOCKS" compiler for C++. C graphis was installed manually too , the link is given below for reference.
